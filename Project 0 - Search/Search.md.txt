# Search

### What is Search?

Search problems involve an agent that is given:
- Initial State
- Goal State
= Return a solution of how to get from the former to the latter

### Terminologies

#### Agent

An entity that perceives its environment and acts upon that environment.

i.e. In the case of self-driving cars, the agent might be the car, that is perceiving all these external factors to determine where to drive towards, in order to arrive at a destination

i.e. In the case of a puzzle, the agent might be the solver

#### State

A configuration of the agent in its environment. 

i.e. In a 15 puzzle, a state is any one way that all the numbers are arranged on the board

i.e. In the case of self-driving cars, the state might be the environment, with all the different locations of roads and traffic lights

#### Initial State

The state from which the search algorithm starts. 

i.e. In a navigator app for self-driving cars, the initial state would be the current location

#### Actions

Choices that we can make in a state. Actions can be defined as a function ACTIONS(s).

So, given receiving state s as input, ACTIONS(s) returns as output the set of actions that cna be executed in state s. 

#### Transition Model

A description of what state we get after we perform any applicable action in any state.

In this case, transition model will be RESULT(s, a) -> given action a in state s, RESULT.

#### State Space

Set of all states reachable from the initial state, by any possible sequence of actions. 

It is usually described in a graph of nodes with directions between each node (state). 

#### Goal Test



#### Path Cost
